# Test Report: Bug-00000006 Fix Verification
**Date:** 2025-10-04 16:53:48
**Tester:** CodeCrew Testing Agent
**Test Type:** Basic Functionality & Regression Testing

## Executive Summary
✅ **Build Verification:** PASS
✅ **Code Review:** PASS
⚠️ **CLI Execute Mode:** ISSUE DETECTED
⚠️ **MCP executeAgent Tool:** ISSUE DETECTED

## Bug-00000006 Fix Details
**File:** `src/slack/slack-bot.ts:171`
**Change:**
- **Before:** `queryAgent` (read-only mode)
- **After:** `executeAgent` (can modify files)
- **Parameter:** `query` → `task`

**Purpose:** Allow Slack Bot to create and modify files, making it consistent with CLI behavior.

## Test Results

### 1. Build Verification ✅
**Status:** PASS
**Details:**
- File exists: `dist/main.js`
- File size: 7.2KB
- Last modified: Oct 4 16:51
- Build completed successfully

### 2. Code Review ✅
**Status:** PASS
**File:** `src/slack/slack-bot.ts:169-175`

**Code Analysis:**
```typescript
// Use configured default agent with executeAgent for full capabilities
// (executeAgent supports file modifications, queryAgent is read-only)
const result = await this.codeCrewTool.executeAgent({
  agentId: this.defaultAgent,
  task: userRequest,
  context: contextText || undefined, // Only pass context if we have thread history
});
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Correctly changed from `queryAgent` to `executeAgent`
- ✅ Parameter correctly changed from `query` to `task`
- ✅ Proper comments explaining the change
- ✅ Context parameter properly handled
- ✅ No syntax errors

### 3. CLI Execute Mode (Regression Test) ⚠️
**Status:** ISSUE DETECTED
**Test Command:**
```bash
node dist/main.js execute "@claude:haiku test-bug00006.txt 파일에 'Bug-00000006 테스트 성공' 메시지를 작성해주세요."
```

**Expected Result:** File `test-bug00006.txt` created with message
**Actual Result:** Agent responded with tool use instructions but file was not created

**Agent Response:**
- Status: Success (reported)
- Agent attempted to use Write tool
- Agent attempted to use TodoWrite tool
- **Critical Issue:** File was NOT actually created in filesystem

**Verification:**
```bash
$ cat test-bug00006.txt
cat: test-bug00006.txt: No such file or directory
```

**Analysis:**
This indicates that while the agent responds with tool use instructions, the tools are not being executed. The CLI execute mode is showing tool use JSON instead of actually executing the tools.

### 4. MCP executeAgent Tool Test ⚠️
**Status:** ISSUE DETECTED
**Test Command:**
```bash
node dist/main.js query "@claude:haiku MCP executeAgent 도구를 사용해서 test-mcp-execute.txt 파일에 'MCP executeAgent 테스트 성공' 메시지를 작성해주세요."
```

**Expected Result:** File `test-mcp-execute.txt` created via MCP executeAgent tool
**Actual Result:** Agent responded with execute_agent tool use but file was not created

**Agent Response:**
- Status: Success (reported)
- Agent attempted to use execute_agent MCP tool
- Agent provided proper tool use JSON
- **Critical Issue:** File was NOT actually created

**Verification:**
```bash
$ cat test-mcp-execute.txt
cat: test-mcp-execute.txt: No such file or directory
```

**Analysis:**
Similar to test #3, the MCP tools are not being executed. The agent is responding with tool use JSON but the actual tool execution is not happening.

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: CLI Execute Mode Tool Execution Failure
**Severity:** HIGH
**Description:** When using CLI execute mode, agents respond with tool use JSON but tools are not actually executed. Files are not created.

**Evidence:**
1. Agent responds with Write tool use JSON
2. Agent reports "Success"
3. File does not exist in filesystem

**Impact:**
- CLI execute mode is non-functional for file operations
- This is a regression - execute mode should work

### Issue #2: MCP Tool Execution Failure
**Severity:** HIGH
**Description:** MCP tools (execute_agent) show tool use JSON but don't execute the actual operations.

**Evidence:**
1. Agent responds with execute_agent tool use JSON
2. Agent reports completion
3. No actual file creation occurs

**Impact:**
- MCP server integration appears broken
- MCP status shows "failed" in debug logs

**Debug Log Evidence:**
```
"mcp_servers":[{"name":"codecrew","status":"failed"}]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### MCP Server Status Issue
The debug logs show:
```json
"mcp_servers":[{"name":"codecrew","status":"failed"}]
```

This indicates the MCP server is not running or failing to connect, which explains why MCP tools are not executing.

### CLI Execute Mode Issue
The CLI execute mode is showing similar symptoms - tools are being "proposed" via JSON but not executed. This suggests:
1. Tool execution pipeline may be broken
2. Or permission/mode settings preventing actual execution

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix MCP Server Connection
**Action Required:** Investigate why codecrew MCP server shows "failed" status
- Check MCP server startup
- Verify server configuration
- Check connection settings

### Priority 2: Fix CLI Execute Mode Tool Execution
**Action Required:** Debug why tools are not being executed in execute mode
- Check tool execution pipeline
- Verify permission settings
- Review queryWithTools implementation

### Priority 3: Slack Bot Testing
**Status:** BLOCKED
- Cannot test actual Slack Bot without running Slack workspace
- Code changes appear correct syntactically
- But underlying tool execution issues will affect Slack Bot too

## Conclusion

**Bug-00000006 Code Fix:** ✅ Correct
**Actual Functionality:** ❌ Broken due to tool execution issues

The code changes for Bug-00000006 are syntactically correct and properly implemented. However, there are critical underlying issues with tool execution in both CLI execute mode and MCP tools that prevent the fix from being functional.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate:** Fix MCP server connection issue
2. **Immediate:** Fix CLI execute mode tool execution
3. **Then:** Re-test Bug-00000006 functionality
4. **Finally:** Test Slack Bot in actual workspace

## Test Environment
- **Node Version:** (from dist/main.js)
- **Working Directory:** /Users/doha/git/codecrew
- **Build Status:** Success
- **MCP Server Status:** Failed ❌
