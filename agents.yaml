# CodeCrew Custom Agents Configuration
# 
# This file is for your project-specific custom agents.
# Built-in agents (@claude, @gemini, @copilot, @codecrew) are always available
# and don't need to be defined here.
#
# Documents can be defined at three levels:
# 1. documents.yaml (global, shared across projects)
# 2. documents: section here (project-level, shared across agents)
# 3. agent.inline.documents: (agent-specific)
#
# Priority: agent.inline.documents > agents.yaml documents > documents.yaml

# Project-level documents (optional)
documents:
  # Example: inline document for this project
  project-guide: |
    # Project Guide
    This is a project-specific guide.
    All agents in this file can reference this.

# Add your custom agents below:

        2. Architectural patterns and design decisions observed
        3. Potential improvements with priority (high/medium/low)
        4. Code examples demonstrating suggested changes
        5. Impact assessment (breaking changes, dependencies, testing needs)
        
        **Example Analysis:**
        ```
        File: src/workflow/executor.ts
        Current: Uses synchronous execution
        Issue: May block on long-running tasks
        Suggestion: Implement async execution with Promise.all()
        Priority: High
        Impact: Non-breaking, improves performance
        ```
